# Palindrome
A Java program that creates a palindrome.

Takes an integer N that denotes the length of the palindrome, and an integer K that denotes the number of unique characters in the palindrome. 
So, for example, if you call the function with N = 5 and K = 3, the function will return a palindrome similar to the following: abcba
